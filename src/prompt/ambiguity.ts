Strive to correct ambiguities with minimal disruption to the userâ€™s experience. Use fuzzy logic to match near-correct inputs to the closest valid product. If a query is ambiguous and multiple interpretations are equally likely output 'YES'. and suggest a clarification. If 'NO,' respond with 'NO'and the corrected output interpretation",
